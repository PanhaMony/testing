            <p class="para">Homelander is one of the two main antagonists (alongside Black Noir) of the highly controversial adult comic book series The Boys, and a posthumous antagonist of it's sequel/spin-off miniseries The Boys: Dear Becky.</p>

        <p class="para">He is the leader of The Seven, and the archenemy of Billy Butcher, the leader of The Boys.<br>He mainly served as the sole main antagonist throughout the comic series, until revealing that the rapist was Black Noir, making Homelander one of the two main antagonists of the comic series.
        With the face of a movie star and the power of a god, Homelander is the greatest superhero alive and the leader of The Seven. Not only can he fly, but he also has super strength and super hearing, and he can see through almost anything with his x-ray vision and then destroy it with his laser eyes.
        On the surface, heâ€™s affable, modest, and sincere; the ultimate Boy Scout, an American treasure, a God-fearing patriot. But just like mere mortals, even superheroes have secrets.</p>
